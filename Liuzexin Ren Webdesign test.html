    <h2>More About Me</h2>
    <p>As a child I was always terrified of earthquakes, even though they hardly ever happened in my town. I was afraid of starving after an earthquake, so I stocked up on rice in the box I used to keep my hamster in. I thought the rice in the box would always come in handy in a pinch. Then it really came in handy. At that time we moved and rarely returned to the old house where I had quietly hoarded rice. Once my parents finally found the time to go back, they were both hungry, but the house was empty. When they were tired of thinking about either going out to eat or just sleeping at home, my mom saw the hamster box full of rice. The one I had prepared for my imagined disaster filled my parents' bellies that quiet and normal night.</p>
